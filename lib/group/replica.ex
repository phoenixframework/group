  ## Protocol Flows

  ### 1. Peer Discovery (nodeup or init)

  Triggered by `nodeup` or `init`. Each shard independently discovers its
  counterpart on the remote node. Both sides exchange cluster lists, then send
  per-cluster `cluster_state` snapshots for shared clusters (always includes
  nil). Merge applies data; conflicts with local entries go through
  `resolve_conflict`.

        └─ both remote: timestamp wins  └─ both remote: timestamp wins

  ### 2. Steady-State Replication

  After peer discovery, all writes broadcast to cluster members. The nil cluster
  uses `remote_shards` (per-shard map); named clusters use `cluster_nodes` ETS.
  Reads (`lookup`, `members`) go directly to ETS — no GenServer involved.

           │                                       │

           │                                         │

  Dispatch groups remote PG members by node and sends one
  `:group_dispatch` message per remote node, reducing cross-node
  messages from O(members) to O(nodes). The target shard is chosen
  by hashing the caller's pid (`phash2(self(), num_shards)`), so
  back-to-back dispatches from the same caller always route through
  the same shard, preserving per-sender message ordering.

  ### 3. Named Cluster Connect (random shard S + fan-out)

  `Group.connect/2` adds local node to ETS, picks random shard S, and sends
  one GenServer.call. Shard S notifies remote shard S, which acks with bundled
  data and fans out to siblings. Randomizing S load-balances across shards
  when many concurrent connects happen.

      Node A                                  Node B
      ──────                                  ──────
      Group.connect(name, "game")
        │── ETS: add self to "game"
        │── pick random shard S
        │
      Shard S                                 Shard S

        │                                       │── bundle shard S data
        │                                       │

        │                                       │
        │                                  Shard S sends to siblings:
        │                                  {:send_cluster_data, ["game"], A}
        │                                       │
        │                                  Shards 0..N (except S):
        │                                       │── {:cluster_state, "game", reg, pg}

        │   (to matching B shard)               │

  ### 4. Named Cluster Disconnect (all shards local + shard 0 broadcast)

  `Group.disconnect/2` removes local node from ETS, then calls ALL local shards
  to purge their entries. Only shard 0 broadcasts to remote shard 0, which fans
  out to siblings for per-shard purge.

      Node A                                  Node B
      ──────                                  ──────
      Group.disconnect(name, "game")
        │── ETS: remove self from "game"
        │
      Shards 0..N (all called):
        │── purge own entries for "game"+A
        │── dispatch :unregistered/:left events
        │
      Shard 0 only:
        │  {:cluster_disconnect, ["game"], pid}
        │──────────────────────────────────────>│ Shard 0
        │                                       │── ETS: remove A from "game"
        │                                       │── fan out to siblings:
        │                                       │   {:cluster_disconnect, ["game"], pid}
        │                                       │
        │                                  Shards 0..N:
        │                                       │── purge entries for "game"+A
        │                                       │── dispatch events

  ### 5. Partition Heal (peer discovery re-runs + conflict resolution)

  When a partition heals, `nodeup` triggers peer discovery on both sides.
  Both exchange `cluster_state` snapshots. Registry key conflicts where the
  existing entry is local go through `resolve_conflict` — the same path used
  for live contention. The default resolver kills the loser process.

  The tiebreaker must be deterministic regardless of which node is resolving.
  The default uses timestamp comparison, with pid ordering as a tiebreaker
  when timestamps are equal (`pid2 > pid1`). Erlang pids have a total order
  (by node name then id), so this produces the same winner on all nodes.
  Using a perspective-dependent tiebreaker (e.g. "remote wins on ties") would
  cause mutual kill — both nodes pick the other's pid, both processes die.

      Node A                                  Node B
      ──────                                  ──────
      (partition: A and B both register key K)

  ### 6. Nodedown / Process Death Cleanup

  `nodedown` purges all remote node data. Local process `DOWN` purges the pid's
  entries and broadcasts unregister/leave to cluster members.

      Node A                                  Node B dies

  ## Cluster Membership Tracking

  The nil cluster is tracked in ETS (cluster_nodes table), maintained by the
  peer_connect protocol. Nodes are added on peer discovery and removed on
  nodedown/shard death. This allows Group.nodes/1 to return actual Group peers
  rather than all Erlang nodes.

  ## Sharding

  Each key is routed to a shard via `:erlang.phash2({cluster, key}, num_shards)`.
  Including `cluster` in the hash input means the same key string in different
  clusters may land on different shards — this is intentional so named-cluster
  operations don't create false contention with nil-cluster operations.

  `phash2` produces near-uniform distribution across shards for diverse keyspaces.
  With 10K distinct keys across 2–8 shards, observed deviation from perfect
  uniformity is <2%. In practice, real workloads with varied key prefixes will
  see balanced shard load.

  **Hot keys:** A single extremely popular key (e.g. a chat room
  with thousands of joins/leaves) always hashes to one shard, so all *writes*
  for that key serialize through that shard's GenServer. However, *reads* —
  `Group.lookup/3` and `Group.members/3` — go directly to ETS and bypass the
  GenServer entirely. Since reads typically dominate, a hot key's impact on
  overall throughput is limited to write-heavy scenarios. Adding more shards
  does not help a single hot key (it still lands on one shard), but it does
  reduce contention between unrelated keys.

  Shard counts must match across all nodes in a cluster. The peer_connect
  handshake validates `num_shards` and raises on mismatch, since a disagreement
  would route the same key to different shards on different nodes, breaking
  replication consistency.

  ## Conflict Resolution is Synchronous

  The `:resolve_registry_conflict` callback runs synchronously inside the shard
  GenServer's `handle_info` (during `replicate_register` or `merge_remote_cluster_data`).
  This is intentional: the resolver's return value determines ETS mutations (delete
  loser entry, insert winner, demonitor evicted local pid, re-broadcast winner) that
  must happen atomically within a single `handle_info` turn. Making the resolver async
  would open a window where another `replicate_register`, `DOWN`, or `cluster_state`
  for the same key could race with the pending resolution, corrupting the dual-index
  ETS tables.

  Consequence: a blocking resolver stalls the **entire shard** — no registrations,
  joins, replication, or cleanup can proceed on that shard until the callback returns.
  Callers must ensure their resolver returns quickly. Any information needed for the
  decision (e.g. priority, version, creation time) should be carried in the
  registration metadata, not fetched at resolution time.

  ## Monitor Event Delivery

  Lifecycle events (`:registered`, `:unregistered`, `:joined`, `:left`) are delivered
  to `Group.monitor/3` subscribers in a batched diff of `{:group, events, info}` tuples.
  Each GenServer handler invocation is a natural batch boundary:

  - **Single operations** (register, join, leave, unregister, replicate_register,
    replicate_unregister): build one event, deliver one tuple with one event per
    matching subscriber.
  - **Buffered replicated PG operations** (`replicate_join`, `replicate_leave`):
    receiver shards may accumulate several ops before flushing, then deliver one
    tuple per subscriber containing the ordered events from that flush.
  - **Bulk operations** (nodedown, process DOWN, cluster_disconnect, cluster_state
    merge): accumulate events into a local variable, then deliver one tuple per
    subscriber containing all matching events from that handler turn.

  Events are built by `build_event/6`, accumulated in reverse via prepend, and
  flushed by `notify_monitors/2` which reverses once, resolves only the monitor
  keys that can match each event (`:all`, `{:exact, key}`, and the key's
  slash-terminated prefixes), caches those lookups per batch, and sends one
  `{:group, events, %{name: name}}` per subscriber. Both functions are private to
  this module.

  `resolve_conflict/5` returns `{state, event_or_nil}` so callers can accumulate
  the event. `merge_remote_cluster_data/5` threads `{state, events}` through its
  reduce, generating `:registered`/`:joined` events for new entries and conflict
  events for existing ones. This means `cluster_state` merges (peer discovery,
  partition heal, `Group.connect`) produce batched diffs with all new entries.
  `build_purged_events/5` takes an events accumulator and prepends purged-entry
  events to it.

  ## Replicated Receiver Fairness

  Receiver-side batching solves the apply-cost problem for both replicated PG
  (`replicate_join` / `replicate_leave`) and replicated registry
  (`replicate_register` / `replicate_unregister`) traffic, but a hot stream in
  either lane can still monopolize the shard if every completed replication
  turn is immediately followed by another one.

  To keep local latency-sensitive writes from sitting behind an unbounded remote
  backlog, the shard gives a bounded local request turn after each completed
  replicated PG or replicated registry apply turn:

  - one bounded replicated lane turn (PG or registry)
  - then drain any already-waiting cluster/protocol messages
  - then drain up to `replicated_pg_receiver_local_request_quota` local PG
    `join` / `leave` requests, or one local non-PG request
  - then yield back to the GenServer loop

  Contiguous local PG `join` / `leave` requests from that bounded local turn are
  staged against an in-memory view and applied with bulk ETS operations, while
  replicated registry flushes are staged against an in-memory view per
  `{cluster, key}` and applied with bulk ETS operations. Other local request
  types still execute sequentially in FIFO order.

  Local callers use an explicit request/reply lane (`send` + monitor + tagged
  reply) rather than `GenServer.call/3`, so the replica can selectively receive
  one local request turn without reaching into `'$gen_call'` internals.

  The fairness model ensures ordering is preserved where correctness matters:

  - all public local shard calls get protection from replicated PG and registry
    backlog, but earlier cluster/protocol messages still run first, avoiding
    stale ordering around disconnect, peer discovery, and cluster sync
  - FIFO is preserved within the local lane because the selective receive matches
    a single broad `@local_request_tag` shape and therefore takes the oldest
    queued local request in the mailbox
  - local PG batching does not reorder within that local lane; it only batches
    contiguous `join` / `leave` messages already collected in FIFO order
