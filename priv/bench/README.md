# Group Benchmarks

Baseline performance numbers for Group's core operations — local ETS reads,
GenServer writes with shard scaling, and distributed replication across
separate BEAM VMs.

## Running

```bash
cd priv/group/priv/bench
mix deps.get
```

### Local benchmarks

Single-node, no distribution required:

```bash
./run_local.sh
```

### Distributed benchmarks

Uses 3 separate BEAM VMs (coordinator + 2 replicas) as OS processes:

```bash
./run_distributed.sh
```

Focused single-shard pubsub fan-out benchmark:

```bash
ERL_AFLAGS='+zdbbl 49152' ./run_distributed.sh --shards 1 \
  --coordinator-expr 'GroupBench.Distributed.run_pubsub_single_shard_only()'
```

The script compiles once, starts both replicas in the background, then launches
the coordinator. Replicas are killed automatically on exit.

## Local Scenarios

All local benchmarks run for both the default (nil) cluster and a named cluster
(`"game"`) to verify there's no performance difference between the two paths.

### 1. Lookup throughput

Pure ETS read — the hot path for Group. Registers 10K keys, then measures 100K
random `Group.lookup/3` calls.

Reports ops/sec and p50/p99/max latency.

### 2. Members throughput

ETS read that returns a list. Joins 100 processes to each of 100 groups (10K
memberships total), then measures 100K random `Group.members/3` calls.

Slower than lookup because each call copies a 100-element list out of ETS.

### 3. Register throughput (shard scaling)

Measures concurrent `Group.register/4` calls — each of 10K spawned processes
registers itself in parallel. Varies shard count (1, 2, 4, schedulers_online)
to show how write throughput scales with sharding.

### 4. Register/unregister cycle

Sequential register + unregister pairs from a single process. Measures the
GenServer round-trip cost of two writes back-to-back (10K cycles).

Reports per-cycle latency percentiles.

### 5. Join throughput (shard scaling)

Same shape as register throughput but with `Group.join/4`. 10K processes each
join a group concurrently, varying shard count.

### 6. Monitor event delivery

Calls `Group.monitor(:bench, :all)`, then registers 5K keys and measures the
time until all 5K `:registered` events are received by the monitoring process.

## Distributed Scenarios

Three separate BEAM VMs on 127.0.0.1 — each with its own schedulers, memory
allocator, and GC. The coordinator drives all operations via `:erpc.call` with
MFA (module/function/args) to the replica nodes.

### 1. Replication latency

The core distributed measurement. Registers a key on replica1, then spin-polls
`Group.lookup` on replica2 until it appears. Repeats 1,000 times.

Reports p50/p99/max latency covering the full path: GenServer call on replica1,
Erlang distribution message, GenServer cast on replica2, ETS insert.

### 2. Bulk sync (new peer catches up)

Measures how fast a new node catches up to an existing peer's state. Registers
N keys on replica1 (1K and 10K), then starts Group on replica2 and polls until
all N entries are visible.

Group sends all data in a single `cluster_state` message on peer discovery, so
this is bounded by serialization + network, not per-key round-trips.

### 3. Concurrent cross-node writes

Both replicas register 5K keys simultaneously (10K total), then waits for full
convergence — both nodes see all 10K entries.

Measures total throughput including the time for all replication messages to
settle.

### 4. Named cluster replication latency

Same as scenario 1 (replication latency) but within a named cluster
(`"game"`). Both replicas call `Group.connect/2` before measuring.

Useful for verifying that the named cluster replication path has no overhead
compared to the default nil cluster.

### 5. Process death cleanup replication

The critical distributed cleanup path. Registers 1K and 5K processes on
replica1, kills them all, then measures how long until replica2 sees zero
entries. Exercises: local DOWN handler → `replicate_unregister` broadcast →
remote ETS cleanup.

This scenario catches O(N²) message amplification bugs where remote nodes
redundantly monitor pids and re-broadcast cleanup messages.

### 6. Register/die churn throughput

Sustained churn: 10 waves of 500 register+kill cycles on replica1, measuring
total wall time including convergence on replica2. Simulates steady-state
deploy churn where processes are constantly starting and stopping.

### 7. Join/die cleanup replication

Same as scenario 5 but for process groups. Spawns 1K processes on replica1,
all joining the same group key, then kills them all. Measures cleanup
convergence on replica2 via the `replicate_leave` path.

All members hash to the same shard (single key), making this the worst case
for shard contention during bulk cleanup.

### 11. PubSub dispatch/broadcast single-shard fan-out

Measures theoretical max throughput for one hot key on one shard under
multi-caller publisher load. Replica1 runs concurrent publishers calling
`Group.broadcast/4` or `Group.dispatch/4`; replica2 owns all subscribed
members for that key.

Subscriber processes count deliveries locally in process state. The coordinator
only polls aggregate counts after publishing, so results are not bottlenecked
by per-message test acknowledgements.

Reports:

- logical message enqueue throughput on replica1
- end-to-end logical messages/sec after all subscriber deliveries are observed
- raw fan-out deliveries/sec on replica2
- per-member delivery count range and remaining subscriber mailbox pressure

```

The bench suite is a standalone Mix project that depends on `:group`. Protocol
consolidation is enabled for realistic production performance. Distributed
benchmarks use separate OS processes (not `:peer`) so each node gets its own
scheduler pool and memory allocator.
